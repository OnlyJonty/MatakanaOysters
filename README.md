# MatakanaOysters
A Matakana Oysters website for my enriched project, based off of the original website at https://www.matakanaoysters.co.nz/

This is my very first coding project so it probably won't be as good as you may expect, if I was to be completely honest I would say
that the original website is way better than the one that I am making right now. I had to make this in a 6 or 7 week timeframe which sounds 
like a lot of time but it really is stressful for when you are making a proper website for the very first time.
